# Introduction
Here I attempt to simulate twitch chat by collecting a lot of chat messages and then using artificial intelligence to predict chat messages.

# Notes
- The authorization token I'm using has been redacted. You can get your own by logging into your twitch account [here](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/)
# WIP

Will finish (probably) after finals are over.
