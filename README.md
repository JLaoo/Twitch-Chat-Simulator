# Introduction
Here I attempt to simulate twitch chat by collecting a lot of chat messages and then using artificial intelligence to predict chat messages.

# WIP
I'm waiting for the next major league of legends stream next weekend to collect some high quality twitch chat.

EDIT: the league tournament chats are too degenerate - I'm now slowly collecting chat logs from DisguisedToast's stream which gets a decent amount of viewers without all the messages being degenerate memes.
